## Statue

By componentizing the statue separately from the plinth, we're able to remove it from the production budget. Customers order the custom statue online. Because it's made-to-order, the price is determined by the 3d printing material. By allowing customers to choose their own material, we can create a range of pricing options suited to any customer's budget.

### Statue Generator

The statue generator can be hosted indefinitely for free, or cheap if it gets *tons* of traffic.

## Web Service

The cost of the web service can scale with demand/budget.

Using a PaaS provider like [Heroku](http://heroku.com) or a CDN, we can support tens of customers for free, or pay monthly to support hundreds or thousands of customers.
