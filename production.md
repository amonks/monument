A number of plinths are produced ahead-of-time and brought to Milan.

The web service goes online at the start of Milan.

Because of the customness of the 3d-printed statue, it has to be produced *after* point of sale. Therefore, the production must be outsourced.

## Production of the statue

At `monument.com` (or something) you'll find an app for generating and purchasing the statue component.

Enter the name, date of birth, and desired URL of the subject, and upload a 3d model. Fill out your shipping and billing information as usual, and you'll get a statue in the mail.

The app uses the shapeways API to handle production, billing, and shipping, so making the statues does not require post-Milan action.

### Making a 3d Model

There are two different options for making the 3d model of the subject. Neither is perfect.

#### *Option 1* 3d Scan at POS

We could use a small handheld 3d scanner like a [Sense](http://cubify.com/en/Products/Sense) to scan people at the fair.

The advantages of this approach are that it's not a huge pain in the ass for the purchaser of the *Monument*, and that we can control the quality of the models.

There are two major disadvantages. First, the subject has to be present at the fair, and buying a *Monument* to yourself is pretty lame. Second, it makes the selling a lot more work.

A side effect is that 3d scanning might be a small spectacle at the fair.

#### *Option 2* DIY

Since statue production is handled by a webapp, we can include instructions for creating and uploading a 3d model after the fair.

Customers can use a cell phone app like [123d Catch](http://www.123dapp.com/catch) to scan a loved one, and then upload the model to `monument.com`

This approach makes sales way easier, and moves quality control into the customers hands. It also opens the door for online *Monument* sales after the fair.

However, having to 3d scan someone after buying something is a pain, and creates a barrier to purchase.
