# Monument

A monument is a celebration of someone's impact on the world, and an acknowledgement of the empty void they leave behind them.

These days, your legacy is manifested as much in intangible media as physical reality.

Celebrate your loved ones with a monument for the digital age.

## What is it?

*Monument* celebrates not only your loved one's contributions to the physical world, but to the digital world as well.

It combines a beautiful 3d-printed bust and plaque with a webserver that displays things the subject made, reflections and memories by friends and loved ones, and a biography of the depicted. It provides a way for observers to leave memories, thoughts, or media.

If *Monument* has WiFi, it'll publish the commemorative website up to the public internet, creating a shared celebration of the depicted person's life and works.
