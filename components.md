Monument combines three discrete components. Any of them could be implemented separately, but they all make up the Monument package.

* Statue

* Plinth

* Web Service

## Statue

The statue is a 3d-printed bust of the subject. It sits on the plinth.

At the bottom of the statue is a plaque inscribed with the name of the subject, the URL of the monument, and date of birth of the subject.

## Plinth

The plinth is the thing you walk away from the fair with.

It's produced ahead of time. It contains a small webserver with a WiFi antenna.

If you're visiting the monument, point your web browser to its URL and you'll find a website about its subject.

You can pay tribute by adding a memory, or some media depicting or created by the subject, and see the things added by others.

If the plinth is connected the internet, it'll publish the updates to the web service.

## Web Service

If you aren't physically visiting the monument, you can find the website online at `nameofperson.monument.com`, but you won't have the editing capabilities that physical visitors do.

When someone edits at the plinth, the plinth sends the updates to the monument web service, and it propagates to servers around the world.
